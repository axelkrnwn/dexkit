Troops

There are 4 types of troops in this game. That is Melee, Ranged,
and Destroyer. the troops can be used to attack another village.
The troops are available in the attack base section where you can 
train them. but training the troops needs time so you don't get 
addicted to this game. And these troops have minimum level 
requirements too. so, you have to consider this when you want to 
train troops.
