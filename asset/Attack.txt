Attack

You can attack two types of villages: Eller villages and other 
player villages. for each village type, gives you some reward
that you can use to develop more troops and defenses. but, if 
you choose to attack the Eller's, you won't get any trophy from
the attack and get more gold than attacking other 
players' villages and otherwise, if you attack other player's 
villages you can get the trophy and less gold than attacking 
the Eller's. But, if you lose the attack, you can lose some 
trophies too. so you must be wise to choose a village to be
attacked.
